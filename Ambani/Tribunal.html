                        </div>
                        <p>Mukesh Dhirubhai Ambani was born on 19 April 1957 in the British <b>Crown colony</b> of Aden (present-day Yemen) to Dhirubhai Ambani and Kokilaben Ambani.   He has a younger brother Anil Ambani and two sisters, Nina Bhadrashyam Kothari and Dipti Dattaraj Salgaonkar.</p>

                            <p>Ambani lived only briefly in Yemen, because his father decided to move back to India in 1958[8] to start a trading business that focused on spices and textiles. The latter was originally named "Vimal" but later changed to "Only Vimal."[9] His family lived in a modest two-bedroom apartment in Bhuleshwar, Mumbai until the 1970s.[10] The family's financial status slightly improved when they moved to India but Ambani still lived in a communal society, used public transportation, and never received an allowance.[11] Dhirubhai later purchased a 14-floor apartment block called 'Sea Wind' in Colaba, where, until recently, Ambani and his brother lived with their families on different floors.[12]</p>

                            <p>Ambani attended the Hill Grange High School at Peddar Road, Mumbai, along with his brother and Anand Jain, who later became his close associate.[13] After his secondary schooling, he studied at the St. Xavier's College, Mumbai.[14] He then received a BE degree in Chemical Engineering from the Institute of Chemical Technology.</p>

                                <p>Ambani later enrolled for an MBA at Stanford University, but withdrew in 1980 to help his father build Reliance, which at the time was still a small but fast-growing enterprise. His father felt that real-life skills were harnessed through experiences and not by sitting in a classroom, so he called his son back to India from Stanford to take command of a yarn manufacturing project in his company.</p>
                                
                                <p>Ambani has been quoted as saying that he was influenced by his teachers William F. Sharpe and Man Mohan Sharma because they are "the kind of professors who made you think out of the box."</p>

                        <p>In 1981 he started to help his father Dhirubhai Ambani run their family business, Reliance Industries Limited. By this time, it had already expanded so that it also dealt in refining and petrochemicals. The business also included products and services in retail and telecommunications industries. Reliance Retail Ltd., another subsidiary, is also the largest retailer in India.[19] Reliance's Jio has earned a top-five spot in the country's telecommunication services since its public launch on 5 September 2016.</p>

                            <p>As of 2016, Ambani was ranked 36 and has consistently held the title of India's richest person on Forbes magazine's list for the past ten years.[20] He is the only Indian businessman on Forbes' list of the world's most powerful people.[21] As of October 2020, Mukesh Ambani was ranked by Forbes as the 6th-wealthiest person in the world.[7] He surpassed Jack Ma, executive chairman of Alibaba Group, to become Asia's richest person with a net worth of $44.3 billion in July 2018. He is also the wealthiest person in the world outside North America and Europe.[22] As of 2015, Ambani ranked fifth among India's philanthropists, according to China's Hurun Research Institute.[23] He was appointed as a Director of Bank of America and became the first non-American to be on its board.</p>
                            
                            <p>Through Reliance, he also owns the Indian Premier League franchise Mumbai Indians and is the founder of Indian Super League, a football league in India.[25] In 2012, Forbes named him one of the richest sports owners in the world.[26] He resides at the Antilia Building, one of the world's most expensive private residences with its value reaching $1 billion.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Make in India is an initiative by the Government of India to encourage companies to manufacture in India and incentivize dedicated investments into manufacturing.[1] The policy approach was to create a conducive environment for investments, develop a modern and efficient infrastructure, and open up new sectors for foreign capital. The initiative targeted 25 economic sectors for job creation and skill enhancement,[2] and aimed "to transform India into a global design and manufacturing hub."</p>

                            <p>"Make in India" had three stated objectives:</p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>to increase the manufacturing sector's growth rate to 12-14% per annum;</li>
                                <li>to create 100 million additional manufacturing jobs in the economy by 2022</li>
                                <li>to ensure that the manufacturing sector's contribution to GDP is increased to 25% by 2022 (later revised to 2025).</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>After the launch, India gave investment commitments worth ₹16.40 lakh crore (US$230 billion) and investment inquiries worth of ₹1.5 lakh crore (US$21 billion) between September 2014 to February 2016.[5][6][7] As a result, India emerged as the top destination globally in 2015 for foreign direct investment (FDI), surpassing the United States and China, with US$60.1 billion FDI.[8] As per the current policy, 100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) is permitted in all 100 sectors, except for Space industry (74%), defence industry (49%) and Media of India (26%).[9][10] Japan and India had also announced a US$12 billion 'Japan-India Make-in-India Special Finance Facility" fund to push investment.</p>
                            
                            <p>In line with the Make in India, individual states too launched their own local initiatives, such as 'Make in Odisha,' 'Tamil Nadu Global Investors Meet,' 'Vibrant Gujarat,' 'Happening Haryana' and 'Magnetic Maharashtra.'[12] India received US$60 billion FDI in FY 2016–17.</p>

                        <p>He married Nita Ambani in 1985 and they have two sons; Anant and Akash, and a daughter, Isha.[66][4] They met after his father attended a dance performance which Nita took part in and thought of the idea of arranging a marriage between the two.</p>

                            <p>They live in Antilia, a private 27-storey building in Mumbai, which was valued at US$1 billion and was the most expensive private residence in the world at the time it was built.[27][68] The building requires a staff of 600 for maintenance, and it includes three helipads, a 160-car garage, private movie theater, swimming pool, and fitness center.</p>

                            <p>In 2007, Ambani gifted his wife a $60 million Airbus A319 for her 44th birthday.[70] The Airbus, which has a capacity of 180 passengers, has been custom-fitted to include a living room, bedroom, satellite television, WiFi, sky bar, Jacuzzi, and an office.</p>
                            
                            <p>Ambani was titled "The World's Richest Sports Team Owner" after his purchase of the IPL cricket team Mumbai Indians for $111.9 million in 2008.</p>
                            
                            <p>In an interview with Rajdeep Sardesai in March 2017, he said that his favourite food continued to be idli sambar and his favourite restaurant remains Mysore Café, a restaurant in King's Circle (Mumbai) where he used to eat as a student at UDCT.[74] Mukesh Ambani is a strict vegetarian and teetotaler. He is a very big fan of Bollywood movies, watching three a week because he says "you need some amount of escapism in life."</p>
                            
                            <p>During the fiscal year ending 31 March 2012, he reportedly decided to forgo nearly ₹240 million from his annual pay as chief of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL). He elected to do this even as RIL's total remuneration packages to its top management personnel increased during that fiscal year. Mukesh Ambani holds a 50.4% stake in the company.[76] This move kept his salary capped at ₹150  million for the fourth year in a row.</p>
                            
                            <p>In early 2019, a court in Mumbai held his younger brother, Anil Ambani, in criminal contempt for non-payment of personally guaranteed debt Reliance Communications owed to Swedish gearmaker Ericsson. Instead of jail time, the court gave Anil a month to come up with the funds. At the end of the month, Mukesh bailed out his younger brother, paying the debt.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Since 2013, total primary energy consumption in India has been the third highest in the world (see world energy consumption) after China (see energy in China) and the United States (see energy in the United States).[1][2] India is the second top coal consumer in the year 2017 after China. India ranks third in oil consumption with 221 million tons in 2017 after the United States and China. India is net energy importer to meet nearly 45% of its total primary energy.</p>

                        <h2>Coal</h2>
                        <p>Coal and lignite production was 731 million tons in the financial year 2019-2020.[7] India was the fourth top coal producer in 2017 with 294.2 Mtoe (7.8% global share).[4] Nearly 80% of total electricity generated (utility and captive) in India is from coal and it is the main source of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

                        <p>According to Greenpeace the largest coal belt in India is at Jharia. Before coal mining Jharia had forests inhabited by tribes. In 1971 the coal mines were nationalised. Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) took over Jharia coal mines.</p>
